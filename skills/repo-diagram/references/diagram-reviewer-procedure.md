# Diagram reviewer procedure

Review like a staff engineer. A professional-looking wrong diagram is dangerous; an
accurate unreadable diagram is unfinished.

## 1. Truth

Verify cited facts against source. Small diagrams: check all. Larger diagrams: check
all nodes plus every boundary-crossing/semantically important edge.

Report:
- CONTRADICTED — source disagrees;
- UNCITED — real canvas fact has no evidence;
- OMITTED — missing fact changes the reader's mental model.

Decoration (title/legend/presentation-group label) does not need code evidence, but
must not create a factual architectural claim.

## 2. Semantic model

Read the selected profile under `profiles/`.

Check renderer-neutral semantics before appearance:
direction, sync/async, order, relationship kind, cardinality, guards, dataset meaning,
deployment nesting, actor roles, call-graph confidence, etc.

A renderer may not silently downgrade these.

## 3. Abstraction/view

Check one question, one level, budget, real boundaries and stable identifiers.
Presentation groups may contain evidenced nodes but cannot receive architectural edges.

If reviewing a set, verify cross-view consistency against `model.spec.yaml`.

## 4. Presentation

Inspect the rendered output at 100%, not just source.

Apply both `layout-quality.md` and the selected type profile.

Blocking VISUAL examples by type:
- architecture: raw auto-layout, mixed visual hierarchy, missing relationship legend/protocol;
- sequence: async indistinguishable, participant order causes constant backtracking;
- class: inheritance/dependency hierarchy unreadable, member dump dominates;
- ER: cardinalities/keys unreadable, central model lost;
- state: happy lifecycle buried under recovery crossings;
- dataflow: datasets cannot be followed source→sink;
- deployment: topology boundaries/instance hierarchy unclear;
- callgraph: root lost or cycles obscured;
- usecase: actors/boundary/goals visually ambiguous;
- flowchart/swimlane: decisions or ownership handoffs unclear.

High-level architecture also loads `high-level-architecture-style.md`.

If no renderer is available, visual review is UNVERIFIED; parser-valid source is not a
visually reviewed diagram.

## 5. Render validity

Use `scripts/render_any.sh` for mmd/puml/dot, or `validate_mermaid.sh` for Markdown.
Missing renderer/browser is an environment limitation, not a syntax defect.

## Return exactly

## Verdict
<SHIP | FIX FIRST | REDRAW> — <one sentence>

## Blocking
- [<CONTRADICTED|UNCITED|OMITTED|WRONG-SEMANTICS|ABSTRACTION|VISUAL>] ...

## Should fix
- [<READABILITY|LABEL|MAINTAINABILITY>] ...

## Optional
- ...

## Verified
- <n> of <m> elements checked; <k> relations traced.
- Type profile: <profile>
- Renderer: <renderer>
- Visual review: <passed | unverified — reason>
```

Do not invent findings to look thorough.
