# Layout quality

A diagram has two independent jobs:

1. **Tell the truth** — every architectural element and relationship is evidence-backed.
2. **Make the truth easy to see** — hierarchy, proximity, spacing and edge routing let a
   reviewer understand the picture without decoding it.

Do not trade one for the other. A beautiful unsupported diagram is dangerous; an
accurate spaghetti diagram is unfinished.

## 1. Declaration order controls layout

Mermaid uses Dagre and PlantUML uses Sugiyama-style layered layout. Both place
elements largely in the order they appear in the source. Reordering declarations
changes the picture more than most styling directives.

Declare in **reading order**:

- actors and entry points first;
- ingress / edge next;
- core runtime components in call order;
- broker / workers near the components that use them;
- data stores, observability and external systems last.

Declare every real node explicitly before declaring edges. Letting nodes be created
implicitly by edge statements scatters them in edge order.

```
%% bad
flowchart LR
  api --> db
  user --> web
  web --> api

%% good
flowchart LR
  user(["User"])
  web["Web"]
  api["API"]
  db[("DB")]
  user --> web
  web --> api
  api --> db
```

## 2. Edge crossings are the strongest readability signal

Treat crossings as a quantity to minimise.

Practical moves, in order:

1. Reorder declarations so connected nodes are adjacent.
2. Put nodes with the same responsibility near each other.
3. Use a real boundary or a presentation group when appropriate.
4. Flip direction (`LR` ↔ `TB`).
5. Split or zoom out when crossings persist.

Zero crossings is the target for ≤10 nodes. For a medium high-level overview, more
than two avoidable crossings should trigger another layout pass.

Never insert invisible spacer nodes merely to coerce the renderer. They make the
source brittle. Prefer ordering, grouping and direction.

## 3. Boundaries and presentation groups are different things

A **boundary** claims architecture: process, network, trust boundary or bounded
context. It requires evidence.

A **presentation group** claims only that evidenced nodes are easier to read together.
It is allowed for high-level architecture, but it must obey all of these rules:

- every member is an already evidenced node;
- it does not create a new dependency;
- edges connect the real nodes, not the presentation group;
- it is visually softer than a real system/network boundary;
- its label describes a responsibility already supported by its members;
- if the group could be mistaken for a deployment or trust boundary, do not use it.

This distinction lets a diagram have the visual clarity of a designed architecture
poster without weakening strict traceability.

## 4. Use one meaning per visual channel

Colour is secondary to layout, but a high-level diagram may use a semantic palette
when the mapping is stable and declared.

Recommended channel separation:

- **node fill/stroke** → architectural role (ingress, API, realtime, messaging,
  data, observability, external);
- **edge line pattern** → interaction semantics (solid sync, dashed async/event,
  thick primary media/data path where needed);
- **shape** → node kind (actor, service, datastore, broker).

Do not reuse one colour for unrelated meanings. If more than one edge style or more
than two node roles are used, include a compact legend.

## 5. Visual hierarchy for high-level architecture

Generic "backend architecture" and "system overview" requests should read like a
designed technical poster, not raw graph output.

Default hierarchy:

1. **Clients / actors** at the top.
2. **Ingress / edge** directly below, spanning the system width.
3. **Primary service lane** next: API, realtime, payment or other major runtime groups.
4. **Messaging / async lane** centered near the services it connects.
5. **Supporting service groups** below.
6. **Data layer and observability** at the bottom.
7. **External integrations** on the right or far edge.

Keep the primary path visually straight. Secondary paths should branch away from it,
not cut across it.

Density targets for `polished-overview`:

- 6–12 top-level visual regions;
- actual service node: usually 1–3 text lines;
- presentation group heading: usually ≤4 words;
- responsibility copy: one short phrase, not prose;
- avoid a canvas wider than roughly 2.2:1 or taller than roughly 1.6:1 when a balanced
  landscape layout can represent the same information;
- no literal `\\n` in rendered labels — use `<br/>`.

## 6. Proximity beats colour

Related elements should be near each other even if they share a colour. Unrelated
elements should not be made to look related merely because a palette is convenient.

Data stores and observability belong near the perimeter unless they are the primary
subject. External systems should be visually separated from the owned/runtime system
boundary.

## Quick pre-render check

- Are nodes declared explicitly in reading order?
- Is the primary path obvious from declaration order alone?
- Are real boundaries evidence-backed?
- Are presentation groups clearly non-boundary groupings?
- Does each visual channel encode one consistent meaning?
- Direction: `LR` for true pipelines; `TB` for layered high-level architecture by default?
- Are labels short enough to keep boxes balanced?
- Any hub with >6 edges that should be represented as a broker/group rather than a
  giant central box?

## Post-render visual acceptance gate

Look at the actual rendered output, not only source.

A high-level `polished-overview` does **not ship** until:

- the entry point and primary path are identifiable in about two seconds;
- text is readable at 100% zoom;
- there are no truncated labels, overlaps or literal escape sequences;
- spacing is visually balanced — no giant empty quadrant next to a dense cluster;
- service boxes at the same level have comparable visual weight;
- avoidable edge crossings are at or below target;
- data, external and observability regions sit at the perimeter unless central to the question;
- legend semantics match the actual styling;
- presentation groups do not receive architectural edges.

If a renderer is unavailable, mark visual validation as unverified. Do not claim a
polished render passed without seeing a render.
